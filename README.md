Emote is a modern emoji picker for Linux 🚀. Written in GTK3, Emote is lightweight and stays out of your way.

Launch the emoji picker with the configurable keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+E`, and select one or more emojis to have them be automatically pasted into your currently focused app.

- 🍾 Built as a popup: quick invocation, and disappears when not needed, does not stay as a standalone window
- 🫠 Provide a large and up-to-date list of emojis retrieved from [openmoji.org](https://openmoji.org/)
- 🧠 Shows the last used emojis by default
- 🔎 Search text box automatically focused and ready to type when invoked
- ⌨️ Can use shortcuts to navigates and select emojis
- ✒️ Selected emoji automatically pasted to your currently focused app (on X11 only)

ℹ️ Note:

- ⚡️ Emote [shows up faster](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/Emote/issues/54) when invoked using the built-in keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Alt+E` by default), than when using a manually registered keyboard shortcut.
- 🪟 Emote under Wayland cannot automatically paste the emoji into other apps, and also requires manual registering of a global keyboard shortcut - [Hotkey In Wayland](https://github.com/tom-james-watson/Emote/wiki/Hotkey-In-Wayland). This is due to intentional restrictions in the design of Wayland itself.
- Pasting on X11 requires [`xdotool`](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool), and on Wayland requires [`ydotool`](https://github.com/ReimuNotMoe/ydotool).

## 🚢 Publishing

### Releasing a new version

1. Bump the version number in `snapcraft.yaml` for snap and in `meson.build` for flatpak.
2. Add a release entry to the `com.tomjwatson.Emote.metainfo.xml`.

### 📦️ Package with Flatpak

To develop locally you will need to have [`flatpak`](https://flatpak.org/setup/) installed.

#### Install

Install `flatpak-builder`, the GNOME SDK, and `flatpak-pip-generator`:

```bash
make flatpak-install
```

Optionally re-generate the `flatpak/python3-requirements.json` if the dependencies in the `Pipfile` have been changed:

```bash
make flatpak-requirements
```

#### Build

Build the flatpak package and install it locally:

```bash
make flatpak
```

Run Emote with flatpak (can also be done from the desktop entry):

```bash
flatpak run com.tomjwatson.Emote
```

#### Debug

In case you are facing issues with the cache not properly updating, or need to reset user data, you can clean the cache with:

```bash
make flatpak-clean
```

To see potential error messages of the flatpak app you can use `journalctl`: 

```bash
journalctl -f -n 50
```

Run the command below if you want to access inside the containerized flatpak app to debug.

```bash
flatpak run --command=sh --devel com.tomjwatson.Emote
```

#### Publish to Flathub

Emote is published to Flathub using the repository [github.com/flathub/com.tomjwatson.Emote](https://github.com/flathub/com.tomjwatson.Emote).

Flathub builds can be monitored at [buildbot.flathub.org/#/apps/com.tomjwatson.Emote](https://buildbot.flathub.org/#/apps/com.tomjwatson.Emote)

To update the version published to Flathub:

1. In the [`com.tomjwatson.Emote.yml` manifest](https://github.com/flathub/com.tomjwatson.Emote/blob/master/com.tomjwatson.Emote.yml#L66) of the flathub/com.tomjwatson.Emote repo: change the commit hash to the commit of the Emote repository you want to publish
2. Flathub checks the GitHub repo every few minutes, and will start a build if a change has been detected. If the build succeeds, it is published automatically after 3 hours. You can use the [Flathub BuildBot web UI](https://buildbot.flathub.org/#/apps/com.tomjwatson.Emote) to monitor, start or publish builds manually (click the Publish button at the top of a successful build page).

More documentation for maintaining a Flathub package is available at [docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/maintanance](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/maintanance#buildbot).

### 🦜 Package with Snap

Ensure you have `snapcraft` installed:

```bash
sudo snap install --classic snapcraft
```

Create a packaged `.snap` file:

```bash
make snap
```

Clean the cache:

```bash
make snap-clean
```

#### Publishing

First, ensure a git tag for the current version has been pushed.

Ensure you are logged in to snapcraft:

```bash
snapcraft login
```

Push the packaged snap to the `edge` channel on the snap store.

```bash
snapcraft push --release=edge <path to .snap>
```
